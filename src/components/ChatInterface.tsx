      "Your stats show strong improvement in the last 20 matches. K/D has risen from 1.8 to 2.7, and your average damage per match is now 520, up 15% from before.",
      "Looking at your last 50 matches, you excel at close-range combat with a 68% win rate in final circles, but might need to work on your mid-range engagements where your accuracy drops by 12%."
    ],
    'weapons': [
      "For your playstyle, I recommend the M416 with compensator, vertical grip, and extended mag. It matches well with your mid-range engagement preference.",
      "Given your frequent encounters in urban areas, try using the UMP45 with a suppressor and half grip. Its low recoil and decent damage make it perfect for close-quarters combat.",
      "Your sniper stats are impressive. The Kar98k with a compensator and 6x scope would complement your long-distance accuracy. Pair it with an M762 for versatility."
    ],
    'map': [
      "On Erangel, considering your aggressive playstyle, I suggest dropping at Pochinki or School. These locations offer good loot and early fight opportunities.",
      "For Miramar, with your preference for long-range engagements, try landing at Water Treatment or El Azahar. The elevated positions provide excellent sniping opportunities.",
      "Given your stats on Sanhok, Paradise Resort would be ideal with your close-combat proficiency. The dense cover allows for strategic rotations and ambushes."
    ],
    'settings': [
      "To improve your gameplay, try setting your gyroscope to 'Always On' with sensitivity at 300%. Also, adjust your 4x scope sensitivity to 120% for better recoil control.",
      "For better visibility during firefights, set your graphics to Smooth with Extreme frame rate. This maximizes performance and reduces distractions.",
      "Based on your device specifications, I recommend lowering shadow effects and anti-aliasing to minimize battery drain while maintaining visual clarity in combat situations."
    ],
    'tips': [
      "Try practicing 'jiggle peeking' when engaging enemies behind cover. This makes you harder to hit while allowing you to spot enemy positions.",
      "When in a squad, use vehicle explosions as distractions while your teammates flank from another direction. This tactic has a 65% success rate in competitive play.",
      "For better survivability in the final circles, gather smoke grenades early game. Creating smoke walls can provide crucial cover during open-field transitions."
    ],
    'meta': [
      "The current meta favors SMGs in close combat. The Vector with extended mag and lightweight grip dominates with its high fire rate and manageable recoil.",
      "After the recent update, DMRs like the Mini14 have become more viable due to reduced bullet drop and increased damage to limbs.",
      "The competitive meta has shifted toward more aggressive early-game strategies, with 78% of tournament winners averaging 5+ kills in the first circle."
    ],
    'team': [
      "For effective squad composition, ensure you have designated roles: a scout with mobility, support with smoke/grenades, a sniper for long-range, and an aggressive pusher.",
      "Your team statistics show strong individual skills but room for improvement in coordinated pushes. Try practicing synchronized attacks from multiple angles.",
      "Based on your squad's performance history, rotating early to the center of the safe zone and holding defensive positions yields a 23% higher placement average."
    ],
    'training': [
      "To improve your recoil control, spend 15 minutes daily in the training grounds practicing spray patterns with the Beryl M762 and AKM without attachments.",
      "For better reaction time, try hot-dropping in Bootcamp or Paradise Resort for 10 matches consecutively. This high-intensity practice improves quick decision-making.",
      "To master grenade usage, practice throwing them through windows and around corners in training mode. Accurate grenade placement can turn disadvantageous situations in your favor."
    ],
    'rank': [
      "To climb from Diamond to Crown, focus on placement points by avoiding early fights and prioritizing position over kills until the top 20 players remain.",
      "For Ace tier advancement, you'll need to balance aggression with survival. Aim for 3-5 kills while ensuring top 10 placement consistently.",
      "The most efficient path to Conqueror involves playing during off-peak hours and maintaining a K/D above 5 with at least 15% win rate. Focus on one map to master its rotations."
    ],
    'update': [
      "The latest patch introduces the new Deston map, featuring unique vertical zip lines and underwater ascenders for rapid position changes.",
      "The recent balance update has nerfed the M416's damage by 5% but reduced its recoil, making it more accessible for mid-range spraying.",
      "A new vehicle, the Coupe RB, has been added in the latest update. It offers the fastest speed on roads but has minimal protection, making it ideal for quick rotations but vulnerable during combat."
